# AstroPaper 📄

The repository for my [personal website](https://seele1306.com).

This website is based on the template **AstroPaper** made by [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing). You can check out how you can create a similar website [here](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). This website also makes use of the color scheme [Rosebox](https://github.com/kraxen72/Rosebox).

## Changes to be made to the original AstroPaper template

- Add reading time for posts from [this guide by the original creator](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/how-to-add-estimated-reading-time/).
- Add internationalization (i18n) support for English and German blog posts from [this Astro doc](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/i18n/).
- Introduce more fonts and color schemes.
- Maintain a relatively Lighthouse score with everything above added.
